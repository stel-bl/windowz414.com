							<h1 class="major">Everything about me</h1>
							<p>To be honest, I wasn't planning to have a big environment like this. Before we begin, I'm reminding you to join my Discord server so you don't miss a thing. You can find it in the end of this text.</p>
							<p>I'm a 20-year-old Turkish girl, who is addicted to software development and EDM. Hated by plenty, loved by many.</p>
							<p>I love to code and develop for community. I have done various accomplishments such as custom ROMs for a Turkish device that only had recovery ports (ft. nift4), upstreaming Redmi Note 10S to Android 12 and 13 before Xiaomi sent out updates and developing a ROM, namely Project Kasumi, that got the attention of a few recognized people.</p>
							<p>I also love to play some games such as "Geometry Dash", "BanG Dream: Girls Band Party!" and "osu!" I'm not that advanced in them yet, just average. I can play up to Normal in GD and osu, and up to Hard and sometimes Expert in BanG Dream GBP. I had also played some games like Vector series, METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE, Minecraft and Need for Speed: Most Wanted.</p>
							<p>What else? I'm also a university student, getting awful marks, managing to pass some classes. Speaking of classes, I have C1 grade in English, measured by a test I had to skip preparation class when starting university.</p>
							<p>Aaaand that should cover the basics of things about me. Below are the links to some random socials of mine and stuff I have.</p>
							<ul class="actions">
								<li><a href="discord.html" class="button">Discord server</a></li>
								<li><a href="twitter.html" class="button">Twitter</a></li>
